__Note:__ This project is not being actively developed any longer. See [ScalaCollider](https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider) for an actively maintained SuperCollider client for the Scala programming language instead.

## Statement

JCollider is a Java library to build clients for the SuperCollider server architecture. While staying rather compact, it provides a lot of the functionality found in the SuperCollider Language (sclang) application. JCollider uses the same concept of mirroring the server (scsynth) objects on the client side as sclang, and its API is fairly similar to classes found in sclang. Some additional GUI helper classes are provided.

## requirements / installation

JCollider is platform independent, but requires a Java 1.6 SE runtime environment (JRE) or development kit (JDK). Since it is designed to control a SuperCollider server, you will have to install one, if you haven't yet done so. The main SuperCollider portal is [supercollider.sf.net](http://supercollider.sf.net/). JCollider uses the [NetUtil OSC library](https://github.com/Sciss/NetUtil) which is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

## download and building

The current source code can be downloaded here:

- https://github.com/Sciss/JCollider

The project builds with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) now. To compile, run `sbt compile`. To see the demo, run `sbt test:run`.

The demo opens two frames, one containing a list of synth defs, the other one being a small server window just like you know from sclang. first check, that the path name to the application is correct, alternatively start the server manually before launching the demo. now select a synth definition from the tables and press the play button. to stop all synths, press the stop button. to view the synth def, press one of the next two buttons. to see a tree of all known nodes, press the right most button.

In the demo, `RingMod` is an insert effects which have to be started before starting an oscillator synth def.

## Projects using JCollider

- [Eisenkraut](https://github.com/Sciss/Eisenkraut) – a cross-platform audio file editor.
- [Superj](http://sourceforge.net/projects/superj/) – an Open Sound Control (OSC) enabled audio scripting server.
- [SwingOSC](https://github.com/Sciss/SwingOSC) – an OpenSoundControl (OSC) server intended for scripting Java(tm), such as to create graphical user interfaces with AWT or Swing classes.
- [Tacchi](https://code.google.com/p/woolooloo/) – combines the multi-touch/fiducial recognition functionality of the opensource reacTIVision, and Community Core Vision projects with the strength of Supercollider in the form of JCollider and the strength of the Java 2D libraries to allow for an opensource alternative to the Reactable.
